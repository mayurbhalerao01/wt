Q2
1. Model the following Customer Loan information as a documentdatabase. Consider Customer Loan information system where the customer can take many types of loans. 
2. Assume appropriate attributes and collections as per the query requirements [3] 
3. Insert at least 10 documents in each collection. [3] 
-- Create Customer table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Create Loan table
CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    loan_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
);

-- Insert sample data into Customer table
INSERT INTO Customer (customer_id, customer_name, address, city) VALUES
    (1, 'Mr. Patil', '123 Main St', 'Pimpri'),
    (2, 'Mrs. Deshmukh', '456 Oak St', 'Mumbai'),
    (3, 'Ms. Sharma', '789 Maple St', 'Pimpri'),
    -- Add more customers as needed;

-- Insert sample data into Loan table
INSERT INTO Loan (loan_id, customer_id, loan_type, loan_amount) VALUES
    (101, 1, 'Home Loan', 150000),
    (102, 2, 'Car Loan', 50000),
    (103, 3, 'Education Loan', 80000),
    -- Add more loans as needed;
4. Answer the following Queries. 
a. List all customers whose name starts with 'D' character [3] 
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'D%';
b.List the names of customer in descending order who has taken a loan from Pimpri city. [3] 
SELECT c.customer_name
FROM Customer c
JOIN Loan l ON c.customer_id = l.customer_id
WHERE c.city = 'Pimpri'
ORDER BY c.customer_name DESC;
c.Display customer details having maximum loan amount. [4]
SELECT c.*, l.loan_amount
FROM Customer c
JOIN Loan l ON c.customer_id = l.customer_id
WHERE l.loan_amount = (SELECT MAX(loan_amount) FROM Loan);
 d.Update the address of customer whose name is “Mr. Patil” and loan_amt is greater than 100000.
UPDATE Customer
SET address = 'New Address'
WHERE customer_name = 'Mr. Patil'
  AND (SELECT loan_amount FROM Loan WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id FROM Customer WHERE customer_name = 'Mr. Patil')) > 100000;
